# The Montreal Video Game Cluster
Introduction

In understanding the historical significance of spaces, clusters of economic activity are key to examining how places become associated culturally with specific industries. There are a number of well known clusters that have become a part of our collective consciousness, such as Wall Street being associated with investment banking, Silicon Valley with software development, and Hollywood with motion pictures. A less well known one that is nonetheless significant to the spatial history of the area is the video game development industry in Montreal, Quebec. Looking at the map below, it can be seen that the marked locations, each representing the large studios in Montreal (studios which employ over 200 employees), are within a very small area of only a few kilometres between its furthest points. The close proximity of these studios and the auxiliary companies that enable large scale game development are what establish the area as a cluster of development. By looking at the history of the cluster in the past three decades, the policies which produced it, its impact on the economic situation of Montreal, and its importance to the cultural image of the city as a centre for creativity and success in the gaming industry.

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, above the map and buttons. To change the bootswatch thenme, change "united" to one of the other theme names listed at [strapdownjs.com](http://strapdownjs.com/).

History

Looking at the creation of the Montreal video game cluster, it is clear that it began with the attraction of French gaming company Ubisoft to the city in 1997, as it would become one of the largest game publishers worldwide and it was after this that the influx of other large developers occurred. The draw for Ubisoft to Montreal was a series of policies financially incentivizing multimedia development in the city, particularly for French-language companies ([Pilon, pg 4](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/usr/2013/957630/)). Building off the success of Ubisoft Montreal and the creation of a number of quality assurance and other auxiliary companies, the city provided greater subsidies and professional training programs which, combined with the growing pool of skilled, creative game developers, established the city as a space for creators to find employment and for studios to have access to a larger selection of talented employees ([Grandadam, pg 1706](https://journals-scholarsportalinfo.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00343404/v47i0010/1701_psatdotvgiim.xml/)). These advantages caused the industry in Montreal to grow, but this growth became exponential as the city became enriched with third party companies able to provide necessary services for developers, allowing the entire development process to be carried out locally ([Darchen, pg 317](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/09654313/v23i0002/311_pfccacgiimam.xml)). This produced the effect we can see on the map, which is a number of large-scale video game development clustered in a small radius, forming a cultural sphere of creative development intrinsically linked to the space it occupies.

Economic Significance

The significance of the creation of this cluster from a spacial history perspective is threefold, the first significance being the economic impact it brought to the city. The nature of the video game development industry is such that when the necessary professionals and creative personnel can be found locally, a development studio will employ locally and disseminate the finished product globally, bringing a large amount of both jobs and capital into the city. The cluster and its economic boons haven’t shown signs of ending either, as EA began a 500 million dollar investment program into its Montreal studio Motive, pledging to create 500 new jobs in the city ([Sinclair, pg 1](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-04-07-ea-plans-to-add-500-new-jobs-in-montreal)). It also, for better or worse, changed the perception of the city’s job market such that it draws in talent from around the world, bringing in a large and diverse group of potential creators.

Cultural Significance

The second significance of the cluster is how it changes the cultural identity of the space it occupies. The forming of the city’s identity as a sphere for creative development in the video games industry had tangible and visible effects on the culture of the area. This is visible in the street festivals, open-day workshops, competitions to attract local talent, and the many other events used both to celebrate the city’s creative achievements and engage with its underground development sphere ([Grandadam, pg 1706](https://journals-scholarsportalinfo.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00343404/v47i0010/1701_psatdotvgiim.xml)). The cultural development of Montreal in the past two decades thus cannot be separated from its video game development sector, as the association of the place with the creative activity and the connection between the various companies that are part of it with the local culture became a dominant feature of the city’s cultural identity.

Broader Significance

The third significance of the Montreal video game cluster is that it provides an example of the development of economic and creative clusters that is recent and easily traceable due to the relative speed with which it developed. Looking at how the financial incentives given by the Montreal municipal government to development studios had a long term impact on the economic and cultural development of the city can be used to understand how clusters can be created and can influence the local culture. This represents a utility for studying the Montreal cluster through the lens of spatial history outside of understanding its significance for the city, as it can help with understanding the general concept of economic clusters, their creation, and impact on local cultures and economies.
